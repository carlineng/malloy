## Development notes:
- The way Snowflake handles casing is problematic. Snowflake is case-insensitive by default, with all identifiers stored internally in UPPERCASE. Double-quoting identifiers signifiies case-sensitivity. Malloy, and all databases currently supported, are case-sensitive. Malloy assumes case-sensitivity, and uses quoted identifiers in some places but not others, which leads to errors where Snowflake can't find columns. See example in `test/src/databases/snowflake/snowflake.spec.ts`
- The `index.spec.ts` tests don't work. It looks like they use a pre-built model on the query results, which don't play well with the casing issues described above (`searchValueMap` in `malloy.ts`).
- Snowflake doesn't store the schema of ARRAY or OBJECT columns anywhere in the catalog. The only way to get schema information is to inspect the data itself. To get around this, instead of querying `information_schema`, I do a `SELECT ... LIMIT 1` on the ARRAY column, and inspect data types using the `TYPEOF` function
- Snowflake's UNNEST equivalent is the FLATTEN table function. It can't be called directly on a column; it needs to be combined with a LATERAL join. Having trouble with `sqlUnnestPipelineHead` in the dialect; and `generatePipelinedStages` in `malloy_query.ts`. It looks like `generatePipelinedStages` is BQ-specific (using the `replace` keyword), and I don't know quite enough about how Malloy compiles queries to re-work it.
- In `nomodel.spec`, everything but the "UDF" tests is passing. "UDF" seems to refer not to wareohuse UDFs but something else within Malloy.
